# Bookeep 

Bookeep is an android app for tracking book reading progress with social and motivational features.
The app was developed for the [MTA Hackathon](http://mtahack.com) in a group of two people, for two platforms - iOS and Android.

## Status

In development.

During the contest a mockup has been created. Several features were added later. Firebase authentication is still in development. Version 2.0 will use Amazon API in order to find a book's title and information from inside the app.

## Reflection

The app was created for the MTA Hackaton, the theme of that year was Smart Education. The idea came after researching and finding the for the last several years people (and especially children) tend to read books less and less. Our goal was to gamify reading books and make it rewarding to read books, competing with friends and family on how many pages each one read every day with a streak counter.

The main challange for us was to work on two platforms and make the same app, in a short time. Most knowledge was acquired during the hackaton itself with the advising of the mentors. One of our main goals was to make an app that is as accessible as possible. 99.6 percent of new smartphones run Android or iOS, therefore we decided to work on those two platforms.

The most interesting part of the project was using Firebase and it's NoSQL realtime cloud database.
